## What is Nexa Stellar?

Nexa is a decentralized crowdfunding platform on the Stellar blockchain. Backers fund campaigns with XLM, funds are locked in a Soroban smart contract escrow, creators submit milestone proof, backers vote on-chain, and funds are released automatically when approved.

No intermediaries. No trust required. Everything is verifiable on Stellar Testnet.

---

## Problem

Traditional crowdfunding has two core problems:

1. Creators receive all funds upfront with no accountability to deliver.
2. Backers have no recourse if a creator disappears or fails to deliver.

## Solution

Nexa solves this with milestone-based escrow on Stellar:

- Funds are locked in a Soroban smart contract when backers contribute.
- Creators submit proof of work for each milestone.
- Backers vote on whether to approve the milestone.
- Funds are only released from escrow when a milestone is approved by vote.
- If a campaign fails or is cancelled, backers can claim a refund.

---

## Features

- Connect and disconnect Stellar wallets (Freighter, LOBSTR, xBull, Albedo)
- Live XLM balance fetched from Horizon API
- Send XLM to any Stellar address on Testnet
- Loading, success, and failed transaction states with TX hash
- Multi-wallet support via StellarWalletsKit
- Wallet not installed, user rejected, insufficient balance error handling
- Basic crowdfunding contract: create campaign, contribute, claim, cancel
- Transaction history with pending / success / failed status

- Soroban escrow: XLM locked until milestone approved
- Milestone management: creators define deliverables with XLM amounts
- On-chain voting: backers vote yes/no per milestone
- Quorum system: 50% participation + 60% approval required
- Auto-release: approved milestones unlock escrow funds
- Refund logic: pro-rata refund on campaign failure or cancellation
- Analytics dashboard with real on-chain metrics
- User feedback system
- Real-time contract event polling (10–15s intervals)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- 14-test contract suite
- Mobile-responsive UI with hamburger navigation

---

## Milestone Flow

```
Creator creates campaign
  → adds milestones with XLM amounts
  → backers contribute XLM (locked in escrow)
  → creator marks campaign as started
  → creator submits proof URL for milestone
  → voting opens (7 days)
  → backers vote yes or no
  → 60% yes + 50% quorum = approved
  → creator releases funds from escrow
  → if rejected or campaign fails → backers claim refund
```

```bash
# Milestone contract (14 tests)
npm run contract:test:milestone

# Crowdfunding contract
npm run contract:test

# Both
npm run contract:test:all
```

---

## Vercel Deployment

Add these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK = testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID = CAHQCXE7OTEJU4UFL3H325RSJVC3RBPUJR4C6CRJHPSQSHAWXWF43JP2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MILESTONE_CONTRACT_ID = CAVKC6G5XI52W3AWUM3MYA7TXDSNXJVZPDZSHOLVFCL7QED3BAFBZW42
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL = https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL = https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = Test SDF Network ; September 2015
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_BASE = https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet
```

Then push to GitHub — Vercel auto-deploys.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main`:

1. TypeScript type check
2. Next.js production build
3. Soroban contract tests (both contracts)
4. Deploy to Vercel

---

## Testing

### Contract tests

The milestone contract has 14 tests covering:

- Contract initialization and double-init prevention
- Campaign creation and validation
- Milestone creation and amount validation
- Contribution and escrow locking
- Minimum contribution enforcement
- Full milestone approval flow (submit → vote → finalize → release)
- Milestone rejection when votes fail
- Double-vote prevention
- Non-backer vote prevention
- Refund on expired campaign
- Double-refund prevention
- Cancel campaign and refund eligibility
- Milestone amount exceeding goal prevention
- Empty proof URL rejection

Run with:

```bash
cd contracts/milestone && cargo test --features testutils
```
